    "# Process\n",
    "- First I examined each data set and determined the variables that connected them.\n",
    "- I then explored initial distributions and correlations\n",
    "- __Sessions data__\n",
    "    - A function isolated key words in the \"action_detail\" column in order to reduce variables and highlight key user behaviors\n",
    "    - I then pivoted the data to calculate the median time spend on each action_key_word per user\n",
    "- __Train_users & Test_users data__\n",
    "    - I joined the sessions data with train_users and test_users to link user behavior with user profile information such as language, age, and gender.\n",
    "    - I built functions to simplify the following categories:\n",
    "        - Age (grouped into buckets - originally I scaled it as a continuos variable but it was hard to extract feature importance this way)\n",
    "        - Device (Desktop, Tablet, Phone, etc)\n",
    "        - Operating System (Mac, PC, Google, Other)\n",
    "        - Gender (replaced \"unknown\" with \"other\")\n",
    "- __Merged Data__\n",
    "    - Once Sessions and User data were merged, I scaled continous variables and created dummies for all others.\n",
    "    - I then began running models, which had less than ideal results (50-60% accuracy) but interesting feature importances."

    "<br>\n",
    "- Browser type is more predictive than OS or device type; this likely reflects that browsers are more segmented by country, as well as the possibility that user experience is improved on a desktop computer. \n",
    "- Most Airbnb users are between the ages of 18-39. There is opportunity to expand older clientelle.\n",
    "- It is interesting that action key words and med_seconds_elapsed were at the top of feature importances for the random trees model.\n",
    "    - \"Wishlists\" are a promising way to predic where consumers may travel\n",
    "    - Users who spend time messaging, updating their profiles, and searching content are naturally more engaged with the service. If these active users could be clustered, more information about their preferences and similaries may be determined. \n",
    "- Men are currently more likely to book listings that women. Could destination suggestions be tailored towards male audiences?\n",

    "    - Airbnb has a unique challenge in delivering its service. It is an international business that relies on the quality of communication of its users. This is demonstrated by the significance of language as well as the variance between cumulative view time and median view time. They traffic a high volume of views but appear to have low conversion. Is that due to cultural, aesthetic, or communication challenges? Further research would be enlightening.\n",
    "- Mobile devices have a negative correlation, implying that they are not optimal tools for using the service.\n",
